# Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

# Example 1:

# Input: [3,0,1]
# Output: 2
# Example 2:

# Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
# Output: 8
# Note:
# Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?
