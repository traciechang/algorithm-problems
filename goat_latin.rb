# A sentence S is given, composed of words separated by spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase letters only.

# We would like to convert the sentence to "Goat Latin" (a made-up language similar to Pig Latin.)

# The rules of Goat Latin are as follows:

# If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), append "ma" to the end of the word.
# For example, the word 'apple' becomes 'applema'.
 
# If a word begins with a consonant (i.e. not a vowel), remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add "ma".
# For example, the word "goat" becomes "oatgma".
 
# Add one letter 'a' to the end of each word per its word index in the sentence, starting with 1.
# For example, the first word gets "a" added to the end, the second word gets "aa" added to the end and so on.
# Return the final sentence representing the conversion from S to Goat Latin. 

 

# Example 1:

# Input: "I speak Goat Latin"
# Output: "Imaa peaksmaaa oatGmaaaa atinLmaaaaa"
# Example 2:

# Input: "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
# Output: "heTmaa uickqmaaa rownbmaaaa oxfmaaaaa umpedjmaaaaaa overmaaaaaaa hetmaaaaaaaa azylmaaaaaaaaa ogdmaaaaaaaaaa"
 

# Notes:

# S contains only uppercase, lowercase and spaces. Exactly one space between each word.
# 1 <= S.length <= 150.
